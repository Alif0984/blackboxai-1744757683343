# Sistem Parkir Otomatis

## Project Overview
Sistem Parkir Otomatis is a web-based application designed to manage parking slots efficiently. It allows users to register their vehicles upon entry, view available parking slots, and process payments for parking. The application includes features such as Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) simulation, payment processing, and an administrative login for managing parking records.
